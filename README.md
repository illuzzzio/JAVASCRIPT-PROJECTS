# Arduino + JavaCPP + Processing 4 Project ðŸš€

This project integrates **Arduino UNO** with **JavaCPP** and **Processing 4**, controlling hardware components like a **servo motor** and **sonar sensor** using a **breadboard** and **jumper cables**. The Java side interacts with the Arduino via serial communication, making it an interactive real-world sensing project.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Arduino C++** (for microcontroller logic)
- **JavaCPP** (to connect native code with Java)
- **Processing 4** (for Java-based visualization and interaction)
- **Serial Communication** (for data exchange between Java and Arduino)

## ðŸ§° Hardware Components

- âœ… Arduino UNO  
- âœ… Breadboard  
- âœ… Jumper cables  
- âœ… Servo motor  
- âœ… Sonar sensor (Ultrasonic HC-SR04)

YOU CAN REFER TO THE WORD FILE FOR MORE DETAIL , video of its working is already uploaded........
download the doc file to learn about more details from my repo........

Also i have uploaded a video of its working .......  so that you can see the real output on processing4 software (Dont forget to download Processing4 software for output)

extra tip:
if you are using this code , please identify the COM3 port on your device , because this code is specifically made for COM3 port , or otherwise you have to do changes in the cpp and java file and you have to change the name of the port............

Thank you
